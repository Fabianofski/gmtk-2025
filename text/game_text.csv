tutorial_btn_0_default,Go back,,
tutorial_btn_1_default,OK,,
tutorial_btn_0_intro,We have. Leave.,,
tutorial_btn_1_intro,Who are you?,,
tutorial_btn_0_end,Please repeat!,,
tutorial_btn_1_end,Got it.,,
tutorial_str_0,Cześć! I don’t believe we’ve met one-on-one like this before.,,
tutorial_str_1,"I’m that voice inside your head you hear when you’ve made a mistake! And boy, was this a big one…",,
tutorial_str_2,The details don’t matter. You don’t remember them anyway. But what does matter is that you’re here to play some Pętla!,,
tutorial_str_3,"Pętla is the discerning time traveller’s card game of choice. You’ll be playing against YOURSELF, FROM THE PAST.",,
tutorial_str_4,"Look below, at your hand. You’ll draw up to six cards from the deck, and then play up to four of them.",,
tutorial_str_5,"Why not go ahead and do that? Pick any cards whose moxie you enjoy, and hit the TRAVEL button!",,
tutorial_str_6,A lot happened there! Let’s break it down.,,
tutorial_str_7,If I may direct your gaze over here… this is your goal.,,
tutorial_str_8,"Your goal is based on the number on the top left corner of the card. You also get bonuses for playing certain hands, like pairs or flushes.",,
tutorial_str_9,Every round will reset your goal to a higher number. The aim of the game is to get this number to zero.,,
tutorial_str_10,"That’s not where it ends, however, because every card has a SCORE, ATTACK and DEFENSE number!",,
tutorial_str_11,"Look around! By pressing that button, you’ve just TRAVELLED THROUGH TIME and are now going against your past self!",,
tutorial_str_12,You must now defend yourself against your own cards. Play cards to build a defense equal or greater than your attack.,,
tutorial_str_13,"(Remember to look at the DEFENSE number, with the little shield icon! If you need help, look at the indicator up here!)",,
tutorial_str_14,That’s the defense phase over!,,
tutorial_str_15,"Check this out over here: this is your health. Unlike your goal, you certainly do NOT want this number to reach zero!",,
tutorial_str_16,"Another number you DON’T want to reach zero is your deck! If you run out of cards to draw before meeting the goal, you’ll lose.",,
tutorial_str_17,And if you lose… the timestream will collapse FOREVER.,,
tutorial_str_18,"So, no pressure!",,
tutorial_str_19,"Anyway, you’ve successfully completed one loop of Pętla. Now, you’re back at the attack phase!",,
tutorial_str_20,"So, to recap:",,
tutorial_str_21,"In the attack phase, play cards to chip at the goal, while being mindful of their attack number.",,
tutorial_str_22,"In the defense phase, play cards to defend against your attack, being mindful of your health.",,
tutorial_str_23,"And with that, that should be all you need to know! Got it?",,
tutorial_str_24,"Great! And, if you ever need a reminder, check out the ticker up here!",,
tutorial_str_25,That’s gonna be it from me. Have fun! Remember the timestream thing!,,
